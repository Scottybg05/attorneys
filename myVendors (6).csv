    "Notes": "Good afternoon Allecia,\n\nI left you a message earlier, but want to follow up with an email. My husband Scotty Gifford and I are Divorce Real Estate Specialists here in the Houston area. We assist clients and their attorneys with the sale or owelty lien buyout of their home(s) during the divorce process. \n\nWe are a neutral voice that provides compassion as well as real-life experience as well as strong negotiation skills between the sellers and buyers and the couple who are divorcing.  We do a great job navigating them through the process of either selling, buying out their spouse, or helping them to find a new home. Both Scotty and I work diligently to create an action plan for your clients and you as a neutral party to the transaction, whether they keep the house or not. \n\nTo our understanding a realtor has been agreed upon for the sale of Kadri estate, which is wonderful! In the future, please consider us for your family law cases where we can provide a Comparable Market Analysis, which is the only value that takes the property condition into account, and as we know this can greatly affect the equity split as well as create that action plan and facilitate it for your clients. \n\nRead more about us here and offer our mortgage buyout or child support calculator to your clients. \n\nWe are also on Youtube and offer valuable videos for your clients.",

We work with clients considering or going through a divorce to help them make informed decisions about their home and facilitate those choices by acting as a neutral party.  Sometimes that means selling the home and often it is buying out their spouse with the ability to tap into 95% of the equity with an Owelty Lien, rather than the standard 80% cash out. We don't hurt one side to help the other! \n\nScotty, and I are both Licensed Real Estate Agents who specialize in Divorce. Scotty is also a licensed Divorce Lending Specialist under Noel Cookman with the Mortgage Institute and I am a Certified Divorce Specialist and the Houston Chapter Director for The National Association of Divorce Professionals. \n\nWe also have a mortgage buyout calculator that many of our attorneys and their clients use in calculating a buyout and we continually need family lawyers for our clients who come to us without an attorney.  Relationship building is important to us! \n\nWe truly want to help others and give back as we are no strangers to divorcing ourselves.  If you'd like to learn more about the owelty lien and/or our complimentary services to you and your clients, we are available for a short Zoom or phone call.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.",

We work with clients considering or going through a divorce to help them make informed decisions about their home and facilitate those choices by acting as a neutral party.  Sometimes that means selling the home and often it is buying out their spouse with the ability to tap into 95% of the equity with an Owelty Lien, rather than the standard 80% cash out. We don't hurt one side to help the other! \n\nScotty, and I are both Licensed Real Estate Agents who specialize in Divorce. Scotty is also a licensed Divorce Lending Specialist under Noel Cookman with the Mortgage Institute and I am a Certified Divorce Specialist and the Houston Chapter Director for The National Association of Divorce Professionals. \n\nWe also have a mortgage buyout calculator that many of our attorneys and their clients use in calculating a buyout and we continually need family lawyers for our clients who come to us without an attorney.  Relationship building is important to us! \n\nWe truly want to help others and give back as we are no strangers to divorce ourselves.  If you'd like to learn more about the owelty lien and/or our complimentary services to you and your clients, we are available for a short Zoom or phone call.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.",
